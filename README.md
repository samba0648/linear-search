# Linear Search animation

The Linear Search Animation React App is a simple and interactive web application built using React.js that visually demonstrates the process of linear searching in an array. Linear search is a basic searching algorithm that sequentially checks each element of the array until a match is found or the whole array has been searched.

This app provides an educational tool to help users understand how the linear search algorithm works by visually representing the step-by-step search process.

## Features
* Animates the linear search algorithm in action.
* Allows users to input their target element for searching.
* Displays each step of the search process with highlighted elements.
* Provides a clear visualization of how the algorithm traverses the array.

## Installation
Follow these steps to get the Linear Search Animation React App up and running:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   `git clone https://github.com/samba0648/linear-search.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   `cd linear-search`
3. Install the necessary dependencies using npm
   `npm install`
4. Start the development server
   `npm start`

## Usage
* Enter the elements separated by space.
* Enter the target element you want to search for in the input field.
* Click the "Start Search" button to begin the animation.
* Observe the animation as the algorithm searches for the target element within the array.
* The app will display each step of the search process, highlighting the currently examined element.
* Once the search is complete, the app will indicate whether the target element was found or not.
